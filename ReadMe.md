# Hi there, I'm Gaurav Sangwan! üëã

### About Me
I am an AI&DS undergraduate student at [IIT Jodhpur](https://www.iitj.ac.in) with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Deep Learning. I enjoy working on projects that involve implementation and learning through hands-on experience. I have been actively contributing to the GitHub community since April 2021 and have created 16 public repositories. My GitHub portfolio showcases my skills in various programming languages, including React, Node, Python, C++, MATLAB, and more.

### Skills
Here's an overview of my skill set:
- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript, C++, R
- Web Development: React, Node, HTML, CSS, Vue
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks: Pytorch, TensorFlow
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Image Processing and Computer Vision

### Project Highlights
Here are some of my notable projects:

1. [Plant-Disease-identification](https://github.com/gauravsangwan/Plant-Disease-identification): This project aims to deploy a dash application for plant disease identification using machine learning techniques. It involves training models on a large dataset of plant images and provides accurate disease classification and diagnosis.

2. [Data-Visualization](https://github.com/gauravsangwan/Data-Visualization): This repository contains various data visualization projects implemented using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in creating visually appealing and informative data visualizations.

3. [ViT-pytorch](https://github.com/gauravsangwan/ViT-pytorch): ViT-pytorch is a Pytorch reimplementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model introduced in the "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words" paper. This project showcases my understanding of transformer models and their applications in computer vision tasks.

These are just a few examples of my work. You can explore my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/gauravsangwan) to see more of my projects and contributions.

### GitHub Presence
I have a moderate presence on GitHub with 6 followers and following 3 GitHub users. Among my repositories, "LowResFormer-ViT" and "Plant-Disease-identification" have received stars and contributions from other developers. I am actively involved in open-source projects related to Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Deep Learning. I constantly explore emerging technologies and strive to enhance my skills by learning new tools and frameworks.
